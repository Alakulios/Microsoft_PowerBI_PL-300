I created a Power BI dashboard for Adventure Works to display key performance indicators (KPIs) that analyze sales performance and marketing effectiveness. The goal was to answer key stakeholder questions about sales trends, marketing impact, and regional performance. To begin, I loaded a dataset containing three months of sales and marketing data for different regions. Using Power BI, I calculated essential KPIs such as total sales, average sales, total orders, and marketing expenditure.

For visualization, I used card visuals to display total and average sales, multi-row cards to show monthly sales and marketing spend, and a waterfall chart to illustrate sales trends over time while correlating these trends with marketing spending. I also used a ribbon chart to identify the region with the highest sales and track how regional rankings changed over time, with tooltips providing deeper insights into the impact of marketing and sales team contributions.

In addition to creating visualizations, I documented insights to address stakeholder questions, such as identifying total and average sales, monthly sales, total and monthly marketing spend, and how sales trends aligned with marketing efforts. I also highlighted which region had the highest sales and evaluated the performance of advertising campaigns across different regions.

Finally, I saved the dashboard and analysis for future reference. This project demonstrated how KPIs can drive actionable business insights by revealing relationships between sales, marketing, and regional performance. Through specialist visualizations like waterfall and ribbon charts, I was able to present clear, data-driven recommendations to support better decision-making.
